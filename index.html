        <h1>Hi! I'm Becca</h1>
        <p>
            I'm currently working as an insurance agent in Colorado and looking to transition into a web developer role.
        </p>
        <p>
            My technical journey started years ago at a Girls in the Middle conference using a program called Alice to code short animated videos. I fell in love immediately haven't looked back since.
        </p>
        <p>
            I joined a full-stack coding bootcamp class in August of 2019 after teaching myself the basics of HTML and CSS. Upon graduating the course I took a temporary insurance role postition for stability through Covid-19. And after buying a house, planning a wedding, & getting sick with Covid twice I'm more than ready to continue this journey.
